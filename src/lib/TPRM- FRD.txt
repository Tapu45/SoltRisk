G3 Cyberspace - TPRM Tool (MVP1) Functional Requirements Document
Product Aim: Soltrisk TRACS.ai
(Third-Party Risk Assurance & Compliance System)
The objective of Soltrisk TRACS is to empower organizations with a centralized, AI-enhanced platform that transforms third-party risk management from fragmented, spreadsheet-based processes into a real-time, intelligence-driven operation.
It equips clients with:
1. Real-Time Visibility into Third-Party Risk
* Enables continuous monitoring of vendors, replacing static or point-in-time assessments.
* Provides early alerts on compliance lapses, cyber threats, or operational failures through integrated threat intelligence.

2. AI-Powered Risk Intelligence
* Delivers predictive risk scoring to help organizations proactively mitigate emerging threats.
* Supports data-driven decisions in vendor selection, risk tiering, and escalation-minimizing bias and improving consistency.

3. Streamlined Compliance & Audit Readiness
* Automates the end-to-end assessment lifecycle-from receiving questionnaire responses to collecting evidence and tracking document submissions.
* Aligns outputs with major compliance frameworks including ISO 27001, GDPR, DORA, and cyber insurance requirements.

4. Cyber Insurance Advantage
* Generates insurer-ready risk posture reports that support underwriting evaluations.
* Enhances insurability and enables businesses to negotiate more favorable premiums through demonstrable vendor risk governance.

5. From Manual Spreadsheets to Unified Automation
* Eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional spreadsheet-based third-party assessments.
* Offers a seamless experience to conduct assessments, exchange documentation, and communicate feedback-all from one centralized platform.

* Initiator logs in and reviews the submitted RIF (read-only).
* Adds comments.

Step 5: Automated Risk Classification
Vendor Risk Scoring Engine
Description:
Upon completion of RIF submission and internal review, the system shall automatically evaluate the risk level associated with the vendor by analyzing the input fields from the RIF and applying a predefined rules-based scoring model (with optional AI enhancements in future versions).

Functional Requirements
IDRequirementPriorityFR-5.1The system shall extract specific RIF fields such as data type, access level, cross-border data transfer, regulatory triggers, and duration of engagement for risk scoring.HighFR-5.2The system shall assign weights to each input parameter as per the risk scoring matrix.HighFR-5.3The system shall calculate a total risk score and classify the vendor as Low, Medium, or High risk based on predefined thresholds.HighFR-5.4The risk level and score shall be displayed on the vendor record page and made visible to the initiator and risk/compliance reviewers.HighFR-5.5Based on the risk classification, the system shall trigger corresponding workflows: e.g., Enhanced Due Diligence for High Risk vendors.MediumFR-5.6[Future] The system may utilize NLP to analyze free text fields (e.g., service description, known risks) and flag key risk indicators to supplement rule-based scoring.Medium
Risk Scoring Logic (Sample Matrix)
ParameterCriteriaScoreData TypePII, Financial, Health+10 per typeSystem AccessYes+10Cross-border TransferYes+10Regulatory RequirementsGDPR, HIPAA, etc.+10 per applicable lawEngagement Duration> 12 months+5Contract Value> USD 100,000+5Known Risks FlaggedYes+15No sensitive data or system access-10Risk Level Classification:
* Low Risk: 0-15
* Medium Risk: 16-35
* High Risk: 36+
Step 6: Questionnaire Trigger
* Based on the risk classification the client can trigger the respective questionnaire for further assessment.
* Client Selects and triggers a questionnaire type:
o Low-Risk
o Medium-Risk
o High-Risk
* System logs action and preps vendor invite screen.
Step 7: Dashboard Update
* Vendor status updates to:
o "RIF Completed - Risk Level: [Selected Level] - Awaiting Vendor Registration"
* Status dynamically updates as the process advances.

3. Vendor Invitation & Registration
