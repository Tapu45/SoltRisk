Confidential / Private- Cross-border transfers: ? Yes- Frameworks: ? GDPR ?

Example: SecureHealth Inc.
1. Third Party Information

Telemedicine PlatformNature of Third PartyEstablishedData HostingCloud - SaaS
2. Nature of Engagement
FieldValueDescription of ServicesHIPAA-compliant video consultation platformStart DateJuly 1, 2025Contract Value$200,000Contract TypeFull ContractDuration>12 monthsRenewal?NoFourth PartyNo
3. Data & System Access
FieldValueData Involved? Sensitive HealthData Classification? ConfidentialType of Data? CustomerVolume of Data? >1 MillionVolume of PII? Above 500System Access? Yes - API, RemoteNetwork Access? Yes
4. Risk Considerations
FieldValueCross-border? Yes (USA ? UAE)Known Incidents? NoneBusiness Disruption? YesCustomer Impact? YesEase of Replacement? DifficultIT Network Access? YesDomestic Delivery? No (Outsourced support from India)
5. Compliance & Security
FieldValueFrameworks Relevant? HIPAA, ? GDPR, ? ISO 27001Certifications? ISO 27001 Cert, ? HIPAA Report Uploaded
?? NIST-Aligned Risk Scoring (1-3 Scale)
Step 1: Inherent Risk Scoring
Risk FactorJustificationScoreData SensitivitySensitive health data (PHI)3 (High)Data Volume>1 million records/year3 (High)System AccessAPI + Remote access3 (High)GeographyUAE is not GDPR adequate2 (Moderate)Business CriticalityDisruption impacts care delivery3 (High)Prior IncidentsNo known history1 (Low)Inherent Risk Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1) / 6 = 2.5 (High)

Step 2: Control Effectiveness Scoring
Control DomainInputScoreTechnical ControlsISO 27001 certified3Process ControlsHIPAA policies and procedures shared2Contractual ControlsDPA + SLA included3Supply Chain RiskMixed geography, moderate risk2Audit HistoryClean certifications3Control Effectiveness Score = (3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3) / 5 = 2.6 (Strong)

Step 3: Residual Risk Calculation
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk ÷ Control Effectiveness = 2.5 ÷ 2.6 = ~0.96
MetricValueRisk LevelInherent Risk Score2.5HighControl Effectiveness2.6StrongResidual Risk Score0.96Low
? Final Risk Decision Output (for TRACS UI)
* Residual Risk Level: Low (Proceed with onboarding)
* Risk Tier: Tier 1 Critical Vendor ? Annual Review Required
* Recommended Actions:
o Maintain SLAs and DPA enforcement
o Monitor any changes in processing volumes or cross-border arrangements
Final Vendor Tier Matrix
Final TierDescriptionInherent RiskResidual RiskBusiness ImpactTier 1 - CriticalKey to operations, sensitive data, high exposureHigh (=2.1)Medium or HighHigh dependencyTier 2 - HighProcesses sensitive/internal data, some customer/system accessMedium-High (1.6-2.5)MediumMedium dependencyTier 3 - MediumLimited access or non-critical servicesMedium (1.5-2.0)LowLow-ModerateTier 4 - LowNo data/system access, replaceable vendorsLow (=1.5)LowNo impact
Output: Vendor Tier - Tier 1 (critical),
